''' Question:
        n $ in bank (Say 10) which we would like to take out. The denominations for bills are 
        1, 5, 10, 20, 100
        We need to output the min no of bills to empty the account.

    Solution:
        if n == 80 
            check if divisible with the largest denomination if not check others
        
        minimize 洧논1+洧논2+洧논3+洧논4+洧논5 given that 洧논1+5洧논2+10洧논3+20洧논4+100洧논5=洧녵
